You'll have to walk a little to get to the lookout but you won't be disappointed.\n\nExplore Caloundra, Maroochydore and Noosa - where you can find great food and beautiful beaches. Drive to Boreen Point where you can hire a kayak or windsurf to enjoy Lake Cootharaba. From Boreen Point turn off to Elanda Point and enjoy a picturesque drive to Wolvi, then north east towards Tin Can Bay and Rainbow Beach. \n\nOn your way to the river-port city of Maryborough you'll have a chance to stop at some quaint fishing villages. Then cruise north to Hervey Bay. \n\nIt's then just a short drive to River Heads to catch the ferry to the unique World Heritage listed Fraser Island.",

Take in sections of the trail in short bursts, or over a couple of weeks to visit the entire gallery network.\n\nTypically, Regional Queensland galleries are the epicentre of Queensland towns, chock-full of activities for the kids, interesting local cultural anecdotes, plus many community initiatives for adults. \n\nMost have public loos, a gallery shop, a caf¨¦, chatty and informative staff and free WIFI (if you¡¯re lucky!). Plus, of course, beautiful artworks to inspire you on your travels. Artworks (but not all) are usually for sale. But the pleasure is often just in the looking and contemplating not in the buying.\n\nThere is plenty of affordable accommodation nearby, as most galleries are located along high tourists routes (particularly along the coastal path). Why not explore all that the Sunshine State has to offer!",

More than 21,000 hectares of farming land was made available for pineapple growing, other horticulture, bee-keeping and poultry.\n\nOver the course of the scheme, which ran until 1929, about 400 soldiers and their families tried their luck farming at Beerburrum. Poor soil and low prices made it financially tough for the former diggers. By 1929, only 69 soldier settlers remained.\n\nIn May 1920, General Sir William Birdwood, described by some historians as 'the soul of ANZAC', planted a camphor laurel tree in what he named ANZAC Avenue.  School children planted more trees to create an avenue, in time for a visit to the settlement by the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) in August that year.\n\nUnlike other memorial avenues in which a tree symbolised a specific fallen soldier (often bearing a name plate), Beerburrum's trees were in memory of 'lost mates'.\n\nToday, only 13 trees from the WWI memorial survive.",

The township offers visitors a chance to soak up more than 80 years of local history - thanks to the town's World War I Interpretive Signage. The signage, including old photographs, recognises Beerburrum's involvement in the soldier settlement scheme for Diggers who served in World War I. Around 500 blocks of land were allocated to returned servicemen, and 437 took up the offer and laid the foundation for the early growth of the towns along the rail corridor north from Brisbane. Don't miss Anzac Avenue and the Avenue of Trees planted in 1920. Signage information is also to be found nearby at Beerburrum State School, and the old Beerburrum Hospital.\r\n\r\nBeerburrum marks the start of the area surrounding the Glass House Mountains National Park and the many lookouts and walking trails to enjoy.",
